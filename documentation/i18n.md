# Internationalization

## Updating translations

Translations are stored in dictionaries at the top of `shape_logic.py`. Raw translation catalogs are stored in the private `cs-academy` repository. To update Desktop CMU Graphics' translations, add the following line to `cs-academy/content/translation/update_translations_in_code.py` next to the other calls to `translate_file`:

```python
translate_file(f'../../../desktop-cmu-graphics/cmu_graphics/shape_logic.py', 'py', args.lang, translations)
```

Then run `update_translations_in_code.py` with the appropriate arguments.
