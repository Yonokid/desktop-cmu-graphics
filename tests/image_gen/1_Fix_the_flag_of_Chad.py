# This code 'looks right', but it contains an error: the blue rectangle is too
# large! The autograder will not accept it until the blue rectangle is not
# overlapped by the yellow and red rectangles.

# This correctly draws the yellow and red rectangles.

# This test case is intentionally left blank.
